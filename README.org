#+TITLE: Calc++

An example project using Bison and Flex to create a C++ parser.

This is adapted from the GNU Manual, which contains a few minor mistakes that
had to be corrected in order to build successfully.


** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ make -C src;
$ ./src/calc++ <(
    echo 'three := 3';
    echo 'seven := one + two * three';
    echo 'seven * seven';
  );
